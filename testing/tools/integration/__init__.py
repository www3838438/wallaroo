"""
Integration contains everything that's required to run integration
tests for a Wallaro application (Python, Pony, or otherwise) via a Python
script.

It has:
    - TCPReceiver: a multi-client TCP sink receiver
    - Metrics: an alias for TCPReceiver
    - Sink: an alias for TCPReceiver
    - Sender: a TCP sender
    - Reader: a buffered reader interface wrapper for bytestream generators
    - files_generator: a file source supporting both newlines and framed modes
    - sequence_generator: a framed source encoded U64 sequence generator
        (binary)
    - iter_generator: a generic framed source encoded generator that operates
        on iterators. It takes an optional `to_string` lambda for converting
        iterator items to strings.
    - files_generator: a generic
    - Runner: Runs a single Wallaroo worker with command line parameters.
    - ex_validation: a function to execute external validation commands and
      capture their outputs

You will need to include /testing/tools in your PYTHONPATH, and the
application binary in your PATH before running your integration test.

Below is an example for running the integration test on reverse, a
python-wallaroo application, using the machida binary, the wallaroo python
api, and the the integration tester utility. The integration test script
can be found at
https://github.com/WallarooLabs/wallaroo/examples/python/reverse/_test.py.

```bash
# Add integration utility to PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:~/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/testing/tools"
# Add wallaroo to PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:~/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/machida:."
# Add machida to PATH
export PATH="%PATH:~/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/machida/build"

# Run integration test
python2 -m pytest _test.py --verbose
```


Alternatively, for a CLI style integration tester, you may use the
`integration_test` CLI. Add
`~/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/testing/tools/integration` to your PATH, then
`integration_test -h` for instructions.
